      "section 3": "For example, the maximum capacity of USDT transfer from Ethereum to AELF is 100,000 USDT. The refill rate is 167 USDT per second. If 100,000 USDT is transferred in this direction, the entire capacity is consumed. After that, if a user wants to send 1670 USDT, he/she must wait at least 10 seconds as the capacity refills. This ensures that the maximum throughput for this token in this direction is 100,000 USDT every 10 minutes."
